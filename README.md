Lightmapping Prefabs in Unity

# What is this?
My fork of Joachim Ante's solution for attaching lightmaps to runtime instantiated prefabs in Unity 5+, posted on the Unity forums here: https://forum.unity.com/threads/problems-with-instantiating-baked-prefabs.324514/
I'm hoping to make something more organized and robust out of it.
